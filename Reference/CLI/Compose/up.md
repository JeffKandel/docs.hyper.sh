## Compose up

	Usage:	hyper compose up [OPTIONS] [SERVICE...]

	Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.

	Unless they are already running, this command also starts any linked services.

	The `hyper compose up` command aggregates the output of each container. When
	the command exits, all containers are stopped. Running `hyper compose up -d`
	starts the containers in the background and leaves them running.

	If there are existing containers for a service, and the service's configuration
	or image was changed after the container's creation, `hyper compose up` picks
	up the changes by stopping and recreating the containers (preserving mounted
	volumes). To prevent Compose from picking up changes, use the `--no-recreate`
	flag.

	If you want to force Compose to stop and recreate all containers, use the
	`--force-recreate` flag.

	  --force-recreate                Recreate containers even if their configuration

	                                  Incompatible with --no-recreate.
	  --help                          Print usage
